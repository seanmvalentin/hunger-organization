<h1>Ways to donate!</h1>

<p>We at Food For Thought understand that times are tough for everyone & money and resources are scarce. However, we need to all remember that we are in this together and anything you give is very much appreciated. For just a single dollar alone meals can be provided to 10 families. We understand that not everyone lives near a food bank and might not be able to donate food, so we offer two ways to donate money to our organization, PayPal, and checks by mail.</p>
