    <h1>what we do to help</h1>
    <p>For a country that wastes billions of pounds of food in a single year, it's almost hard to believe that anyone could go hungry in Florida let alone America as a whole. Yet sadly many unfortunate folks find themselves thinking about how they are going to eat tomorrow, let alone how they are going to feed their families.</p><br>
    <p><img src="givingtothepoor.jpg" alt="image of people being helped"></p>
<p>We at the Food for Thought organization are doing our part by partnering with <strong>local food producers and supermarkets</strong> in order to provide<em> fresh nourishing food</em> to people who need it, allowing them to have a <em>balanced diet</em> as it is essential to succeeding in school, complementing medication and battling the disease. By partnering up with local food producers and supermarkets we can also prevent food waste by rescuing surpluses of food that can be use in the fight against hunger. Another way we are helping locally is by setting up <strong>fundraisers and events</strong> to hopefully spread awareness by sharing pamphlets that contain research and facts in regards to fighting against hungry as well as local charities.</p>
