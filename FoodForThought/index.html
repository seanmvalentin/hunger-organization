  <p>Welcome to Food For Thought!</p><br>
<p>Here at Food For Thought, we are working hard to feed and support lower-income families, the elderly, children, and homeless shelters in need in the state of Florida. Due to the current outbreak of the <strong>covid-19 virus</strong>, our mission is now more important than ever before and we want to encourage anyone who can, to open their hearts and donate any <strong>non-perishable/canned foods</strong> so that those less fortunate can have a healthy and filling meal in such trying and dark times. However, if for whatever reason you can not donate food we also encourage cash donations, for every dollar donated 10 meals are provided to those who otherwise are forced to go without food.</p>
